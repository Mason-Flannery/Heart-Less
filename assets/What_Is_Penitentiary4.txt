You said this is a prison?

“I did. The very bottom Layer. This is where all the criminals go, when they commit Sin. You must have come here because you committed a Sin.”

But I don't remember committing any crimes

“Not crimes, kid! Sin! Even if you didn’t hurt anyone, you still did a Sin. No one else would know it. Even you wouldn’t know it. But your heart would know it. And that is enough to get you put
into this prison. The moment you were born into the Overworld, your heart was heavy with Sin. Sounds like you lie to yourself.”

Lie about what?

“Lie about coming here. The Overworld is where you go when you wish to give up. Perhaps you really don’t want to leave. Why lie to yourself?”

But don’t others want to go back?

“Words of a liar! You came here because you didn’t want to go back. Because life was hard. That’s why we’re all here. But you want to go back to a life of challenge and sacrifice? I envy a stupid kid like you.”
