Checking the bathroom is just as pleasing as looking around the rest of the yellow room. The
walls were yellow, the shower was yellow, the curtains were yellow, the tub was yellow, the toilet
bowl was yellow, even the scum ring around the toilet was yellow. A different shade of yellow.
Disgusting!

If the mirror wasn’t reflecting all this yellow, you’re certain it would be yellow too. But
that wasn’t what caught your attention in the reflection. What caught your attention was your
figure. You looked at your own face, only, it wasn’t your face, but a heart for a head. A giant
heart, but not like a real human heart. More like those hearts you see as boxes of chocolates on
Valentine’s Day, with two little blue eyes staring back from the heart. It wasn’t a beating heart,
but something about it, floating over the nub of your neck, where your head was. Now that you
remember, you did get your head cut off from… something. What was it? A train barreling
across your neck after falling in a drunken stupor? A car accident into the back of a truck
carrying window panels? Maybe an angry girlfriend coming in at night and taking your head off
with an axe? It was blurry and, at the moment, far from important right now.

After admiring your new head in a blend of confusion, fear, and just uncertainty, you come to notice your attire. A
plain white shirt with short sleeves, some jean shorts that stop just under the knees and no
shoes or socks. Your appearance is very dull, but you make up for it in character and having a
heart for a head. You decide that there are worse things to have replace your head, so you pull
yourself from the mirror after getting used to your new life as a freak and head out of the
bathroom.
