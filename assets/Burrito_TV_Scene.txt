The Lord? Is he in charge?

“Well… Yes and no. Authority over this layer as a protector, but that doesn’t exactly give them special privileges. They just happen to be the strongest in the Layer and are personally chosen by the Gatekeeper to keep anyone from leaving the Layer."

"The Lord of this Layer is Damus."

"Damus the Chain"

So he’s just a regular guard?

“Not even. He’s a prisoner like us. No one knows why he was thrown in here, but I assume it
was just to keep an eye on any escapees”

I'll keep an eye on him

“Wait! You don’t plan on escaping from this place, do you?”

I do. I gotta get back

“But, do you really want that? You were summoned here for a reason, weren’t you?”

I don't know. But I'll figure it out.

“I see. Well, I can’t stop you. But I also can’t just help you, not without some help from you first.
Do you think you could turn the TV on for me? You know how much I love a good bed, so if you
could turn it on, I’d appreciate it.”
