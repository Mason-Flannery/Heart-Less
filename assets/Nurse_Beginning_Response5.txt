“Ah, Number 42. Good to see that you are awake and just in time for the recreational period. How are you feeling? Lightheadedness? Stomach cramps? A desire to gnaw your own limbs
off? Dizziness? Fatigue? Visions of demons stalking you in your sleep?”

What? No...No, nothing like that. Listen, where am I?

“Plato’s Penitentiary, obviously. I thought you were filled in the second you came in. Did you not pay attention to the Ferryman when you were sent here?”

Ferryman? Lady, you’re not making much sense.

“Sigh. Clearly, you are not educated in the way things work here. Listen, Number 42. You are here because you died. You quit. You gave up in life and you wanted an escape.”

Dead!?

“Please don’t interrupt. It’s rude. As I was saying, you are in the penitentiary. You must have committed a crime somewhere in your short time here. The act of trying again. That’s a big no-no here in The Overworld”

Lady, this doesn’t make sense

“That’s Nurse Lady to you. And as I was saying, this is where you go when you give up in life. Listen, I am a very busy woman, Number 42. If you have more questions, I advise speaking to
other staff or other Numbers here. I’m sure they can fill you in. But just don’t say anything to rile them up. They can be a bit cranky.”
