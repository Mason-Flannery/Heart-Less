Does everyone die before they come here?

“Sometimes. Sometimes they just sleep one day and decide never to wake up. Sometimes they just leave their families and friends one day and stumble upon this place. The Overworld doesn’t
exactly have a concrete reason to come for you. You have to just… not care anymore. Eventually, The Overworld will hear your call and come for you.”
