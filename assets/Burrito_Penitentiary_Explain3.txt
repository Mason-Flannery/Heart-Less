This prison. Know anything about it?

“Well, recreational period is between 4AM to 4AM. We can explore as we please. Meals are usually served around midday and midnight. There’s a courtyard outside where we play with the can. Just nearby is a TV room if you are interested in that."

"They usually tell you these things when you first arrive.”

The nurse was busy, apparently

“Oh well. Well, if you’re looking for the TV room, you can find it down the hall to the left. Of course, prison is still a prison. Some people here can get a bit rowdy."

"Always remember to save your soul.”

My soul?

“Well yes? In The Overworld, you don’t really die. Rather, you just… start over. A benefit or a curse, some would say. When you save your soul, you’ll be able to return to a spot you last put down when you are slain. After all, you don’t want to go all the way back to your bedroom. That would just get exhausting after a while.”

Doesn’t the staff do anything about the fights here?
