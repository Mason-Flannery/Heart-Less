# Heart-Less

<h2>Heart/Less</h2> 

<h4><em>Death is always present - save your soul!</em></h4>

Original concept by ~ Mason Flannery, Nathan Abney, Benjamin Phillips </p>
<em>Writing by NIK</em>

<h4><em>What is it?</em></h4>
Heart/Less is a text-based rpg that we, as a small group, wanted to develop - because we could. 
Recently, I (Mason) graduated, and decided that we needed a proper sendoff. 

It's an original story written by NIK. I can't say anything here, <STRONG>play the game!</STRONG>

</p> <h4><em>What would you do for a second chance?</em></h4>
